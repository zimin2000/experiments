    "Let $P_n$ be the probability that the last passenger will take his original place having N passengers in line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is clear that $P_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Namely, with 50% chance the drunk will take his own seat and with 50% the seat of the other person.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To compute the probability of $P_N$ the following reccurent formula can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_N = \\frac{1}{N}(0+1+\\sum_{i=2}^{N-1}{P_i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1. Let's assume the drunk ($1^{st}$) passenger took other's ($j^{th}$) person seat. In this case we are having exactly the same problem as the original starting $j^{th}$ pasenger, but for a shorter line ($N-j+1$), so the probability of the last person to take his place in this shorter line is $P_{N-j+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, \n",
    "  * there are $N-j+1$ passengers in line and each of them is having their own places free.\n",
    "    - note that for $N-j+1$ passenger's (that is first in the shorter line) \"own\" place will be the place of the original drunk ($1^{st}$) passenger (that is for sure not occupied as otherwise everyone would perfectly took their places)\n",
    "  * and we are computing the probability of the last person taking his place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2. There might be a good way to generalize for the case the $1^{st}$ passenger is taking the seat of the first passenger (his own) or the seat of the last passenger, but I don't see them, so I handle them separately. These are 0 and 1 in the formula. \n",
    "  * Namely, if the $1^{st}$ took his own place, the probability of the last to take his place is 1\n",
    "  * and if he took the place of the last passenger, the probability is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3. It is clear that probability for the drunk person to take place of a specific person in the line is equal and it is equalt to $\\frac{1}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Mathemadical Induction let's prove that $P_n=\\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1. It was proven already that $P_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "3.2. Now assume that $P_i = \\frac{1}{2}$ for all $2<=i<=N-1$ and using this fact we will prove it for $P_N$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_N = \\frac{1}{N}(0+1+\\sum_{i=2}^{N-1}{P_i}) = \\frac{1}{N}(0+1+\\sum_{i=2}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{N}(\\frac{N}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$"
